        <p class="student">By: Maud van Boven <br> Student ID: 1247467</p>
        <p> Is there a correlation between the consumer confidence index and the
            percentage (of total headcount) women in science? To find an answer,
            scatterplots depicting data from several countries for several years
            are shown below. One can choose the year of which a plot is shown by
            using the slider under the plot. <br>
            The rather constant consumer confidence indexes that are seen over
            the much wider range of percentage women in science, suggest that
            there is no correlation between the two variables shown on our axes.
