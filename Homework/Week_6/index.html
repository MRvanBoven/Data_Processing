        <p> What's the character gender ratio in all Star Trek series, seasons
            and episodes? Click the corresponding arc in the sunburst
            diagram (left) below, and find out! You can also zoom in on the
            sunburst by double-clicking an arc. Zoom back out by double-clicking
            the middle. Hover over the arcs in the character ratio donut chart 
            (right) to see how many characters of each gender exactly showed up. 
            To boldly go where no {insert gender} has gone before!<br>

        <p class="conclusion">As is evident from the graphs, there is a large
            prevalence of male characters in most Star Trek series. However,
            newer series tend to have a more equal female:male ratio, and the
            newest Star Trek series, Star Trek: Discovery, even has an almost
            50/50 ratio. Also noticable is that no other character genders than 
            female, and male appear in all series, for as far as they are known.
